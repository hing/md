# Meet md!

A static site generator that moves the **generator** part to the browser.
This site is plain text files that written in **Markdown** with a **md.js** 
included on each page that renders the theme and assets as needed.

Go ahead, take a look at the source code for this page.

	You want my page, fine, you render it! 
	                                   ~ Markdown


You see, there is really no need for the server to generate anything for 
simple markdown-based sites like this. The Browser just spend a few 
processor cycles to render the page instantly. truly **NoBackEnd**!
